If so, an app could also be co-created for constructing reports.\n\nHE models\n\nCommon hope to move from VBA macro based excel, to R/Shiny to generate static excel docs\n\nEQ-5D\n\nOverlap in potential to collaborate on implementation of tariffs in R to prevent duplication\n\nMethods\n\nAgreement to apply to setup workstream under ASA WG for HTA relevant methods gaps\nDiscussed were flexsurv and maic extensions being common between companies\nBayesian curve extrapolation using spline incorporating (there is literature):\n\nGeneral population for comparator\nConstraint prior\nTreatment arm and comparator should converge\n\nDownstream is presenting these methods to users (e.g. Roche’s TTLA app for RWD, NICE EHDEN shiny app for curve extrapolation)"
