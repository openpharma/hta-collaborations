If so, an app could also be co-created for constructing reports.\n\nHE models\n\nCommon hope to move from VBA macro based excel, to R/Shiny to generate static excel docs\n\nEQ-5D\n\nOverlap in potential to collaborate on implementation of tariffs in R to prevent duplication\n\nMethods\n\nAgreement to apply to setup workstream under ASA WG for HTA relevant methods gaps\nDiscussed were flexsurv and maic extensions being common between companies\nBayesian curve extrapolation using spline incorporating (there is literature):\n\nGeneral population for comparator\nConstraint prior\nTreatment arm and comparator should converge\n\nDownstream is presenting these methods to users (e.g. Roche’s TTLA app for RWD, NICE EHDEN shiny app for curve extrapolation)"

    "text": "Notes\nAs discussed as planned in the kick off, statistical collaboration has moved to a formal working group (under the R-HTA umbrella).\nThe discussion highlighted that Merck and Roche are currently focussed on different parts of the pipeline. Roche is focussed on the step of converting ADaMs to an ARD for later use in an HTA setting. Merck is focussed on starting at the ARD, and creating tools to explore and prepare insights.\nIt was clear that the format of the Roche and Merck ARDs (and the CDISC proposed ARD) are all vastly different.\n\n\n\nHTA Tools\n\n\nDiscussion highlighted that if we could come up with an agreed ARD, Roche and Merck could build an end-to-end solution by later connecting our two efforts."
